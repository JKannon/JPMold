JPM was presented with the challenge of producing a testing framework that has a very strong foundation and ensures free radical resource allocation.

          <p>
            A team of 3 consultants were assigned to the client and they started reviewing and analyzing the existing processes across departments. Some of the techniques of data gathering were by meeting with the Managers, Quality assurance team members and the development team. After a thorough analysis of the existing processes the team presented the recommended changes in the processes and also in the Test environment setup.

            In order to release some of the members of the Quality team members to join the automation effort, JPM manual testers were brought in. Due to the extensive knowledge that every one at JPM brings in, the ramp up time was minimum and client resources were freed up.
          </p>

            With a team of automation experts from JPM leading the effort a common framework was implemented across departments. Our Consultants also worked closely with the key resources identified by the client to ensure knowledge transfer. By establishing a common framework across departments, cross department resource allocation was made possible.
